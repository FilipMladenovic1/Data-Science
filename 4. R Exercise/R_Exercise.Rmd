## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r load_data}
# import the data("iris")

iris
```

```{r scatter_plot}
# make a scatter plot with x-axis: Sepal.Length and y-axis: Sepal.Width, and the species should be shown in different colors

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Sepal Length", y = "Sepal Width", color = "Species")
```

```{r regression_line}
# add regression line for the previous plot with the whole dataset (regardless of the species)

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(x = "Sepal Length", y = "Sepal Width")
```
```{r pearson_correlation}
# calculate the Pearson correlation for this plot

correlation <- cor(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width)

correlation
```

```{r boxplot}
# make the boxplot for Petal.Width with 3 species separately in the x-axis in different colors

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(iris, aes(x = Species, y = Petal.Width, fill = Species)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Species", y = "Petal Width") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("setosa" = "blue", "versicolor" = "green", "virginica" = "red"))
```
```{r histogram}
# make the histogram for Petal.Width with 3 species separately in x-axis in different colors

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(iris, aes(x = Petal.Width)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2, aes(fill = Species), position = "dodge") +
  labs(x = "Petal Width", y = "Frequency") +
  facet_wrap(~Species, scales = "free_x") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("setosa" = "blue", "versicolor" = "green", "virginica" = "red"))
```
```{r t-test}
# run the t-test of Petal.Width between setosa and virginica, and give the conclusion if the width is a statistically significant difference between 2 species

setosa_petal_width <- iris$Petal.Width[iris$Species == "setosa"]
virginica_petal_width <- iris$Petal.Width[iris$Species == "virginica"]

t_test_result <- t.test(setosa_petal_width, virginica_petal_width)

t_test_result

# Result: Since the p-value is much smaller than 0.05, there is a statistically significant difference in petal width between the setosa and virginica species.
