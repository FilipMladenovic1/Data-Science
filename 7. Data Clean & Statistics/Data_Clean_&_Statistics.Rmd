## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Comment: The conclusion based on the ANOVA test results is that there is no significant difference between the various smoking status groups in terms of the number of hospital visits, given the p-values obtained for each group (p > 0,05). Thus, there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that smoking status does not have a significant effect on the number of hospital visits. The violin plots also suggest the same, since they all look very similar, with the sole exception of the "Prefer not to answer"-plots, but those may be neglected, since there are only nine people in total, who chose not to answer.

This indicates that there is no statistically significant difference in disease prevalence across different age groups. As can be observed, the prevalence of the different age groups is always somewhere between 0,21 and 0,27, which is not that broad of a range for there to be a significant difference. Though it must be noted, that the number of patients in each age group is not equally divided, ranging from 35 to 1523, which is a huge difference, that may impact the overall results.
